2. Retrieve the details of a concrete member report via get_report_details, using the most recent member id
   from 'recent_member_ids'. Retrieve further members via get_equivalence_class if one instance is inconclusive.
3. Investigate the root cause in the Penpot codebase using the code analysis tools at your disposal
   (symbol search, memories, REPL evaluation, git history).
4. Write a markdown report with the sections: Summary, Root Cause, Evidence, Affected Code,
   Suggested Fix, Severity. If the analysis remains inconclusive, report your findings and open questions instead.
5. Store the report via store_insight (passing the id of the report instance you analyzed and your model name as author).
Then continue with the next class. Do not skip storing an insight for an analyzed class."""
